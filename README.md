# Project objective
Cracks in asphalt roads are one of the most important type of deterioration a road can face. They allow water to filter down to the base of the road, causing the deformation of the road and the appearance of potholes. Eventually, all these problems originated by cracks make the road virtually unusable. Therefore, detecting and repairing cracks is crucial to extend pavement's life. Unfortunately, nowadays, crack inspection is done manually, requiring a lot of effort and time. This project has the objective to improve and automate the visual inspection of asphalt roads by using convolutional neural networks and a GPS to detect, classify and locate where the cracks are in a map, that can easily show the information gathered by the system.
